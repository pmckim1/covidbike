									<h2>Key Findings</h2>
								</header>
								<hr />
								<li>Both NYC and DC saw changes to overall ride patterns as the pandemic spread and active cases and government regulations increased </li>
								<li> For overall trends we see that in NYC, unlike DC, at first the overall number of rides increased.  This possibly correlates to when the public transportation system 
								in the NYC first was severely restricted and citizens were trying to find transportation that did not involve interacting with a multitude of people. </li>
								<li> However, after this initial surge, NYC follows the pattern previously seen in the DC numbers and drops below the number or rides seen in April of last year.
								 However, the numbers began to rebound as time went on.  In May and June, NYC was very close to the same number of rides seen the previous summer.  </li>
								<li> Both cities are currently experiencing an increase in the rides being taken. However, DC has taken longer to rebound and is still far below normal levels while NY is only slightly below normal levels. </li>
								<li> In DC although overall ridership was down in June compared to the previous year, there is evidence that the recent Black Lives Matter protests had an effect on amount and overall ride patterns. 
								We can clearly see spikes of rides starting and ending in areas where large scale Black Lives Matter protests were taking place and more rides taking place.  This is notable 
								because the stations showing the highest ridership on these days where not otherwise seen as such strong hotspots before protests of this size took place or in the weeks after 
								the scale of the demonstrations began to wane. </li>
								<li>In NYC, although there were many reports of demonstrations, including some that were bike ride specific, it was harder to pinpoint if any of the activity we saw was 
								correlated with these activities.  This is possibly due to the fact that NYC’s protests were much more spread-out and did not have one major point of convergence. Also, the fact that they were ride based rather than destination based made them harder to track.  </li>
								<li> Some spikes in terms of location destination for NYC coincide with medical facilities.  This could indicate that medical professionals are turning to Citibike share to find a safe way to get to work.   </li>
								<li> Both NY and DC both had a higher percentage of “Casual” bike riders and rides spread out across the city and away from transportation hubs. Length of ride grew for 
								both cities for pandemic versus nonpandemic. This may indicate that an increased number of people were trying out bikeshares as a new form of exercise or transportation.  </li>
